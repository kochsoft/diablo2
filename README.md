# About a Use Case and More

Consider the Barbarian finding the **sacred globe of divine world domination**,
that the sorceress has been looking for all these years. That brute does not
even know how to equip it to bash a zombie's head in. And there is just no way
to give it to the Sorceress.

Sad. Really sad.

No more! Using the horadric python script, the Barbarian may just put the sacred
globe into his Horadric Cube! If she is of the courteous type, the Sorceress may
put some glass perls into her own Horadric Cube as well.

Then exit the game. I trust you know how to employ the script's --exchange
function? It will cause the contents of both characters' Horadric Cubes to
change places by acting on their `.d2s` character files.

For this, vanilla Python 3 is needed. Required level is not quite known.
Python >=3.13 should do nicely though.

You may be pleased to read that this script has more capabilities. I have to
leave it to you, to employ the scripts --help function to find out more.
